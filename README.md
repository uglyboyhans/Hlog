# Hlog
A weblog system.

I am trying to develop it~

Notice:
  1.use mysql as DBMS,you should create database "hlog" in mysql and create tables in hlog rely on the file "sql.sql";
  2.some files or folders are not in the project root dirctory,such as ckeditor and userData(user upload their files will store in it);
